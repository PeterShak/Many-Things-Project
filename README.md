# Many-Things-Project
## Planning
I want to create a ball bounce game where you have to stop balls from falling with a mouse controlled pong like square that changes the direction of the falling objects in a random way (moving left? now you move right). Over time, the balls fall progressively faster and if any of the balls hit the ground, then the game gets paused and all the objects on screen freeze in place. Then, a button is pressed, the game resets.
