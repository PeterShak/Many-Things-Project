# Many-Things-Project
##Planning
I want to create a ball bounce game where you have to stop balls from falling with a pong like square that reverses the direction of the falling objects. Over time, the balls fall progressively faster and if any of the balls hit the ground, then the game gets paused and all the freeze in place. Then, a button is pressed, the game resets.
